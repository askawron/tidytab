# tabr

Create tables of frequencies

[![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/tabr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tabr)
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

## Installation

You can install statascii from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gvelasq2/tabr")
```

## Usage

```{r example, message = FALSE}
# setup
library(dplyr)
library(tabr)

# one-way table of frequencies
mtcars %>% tab(cyl)

# two-way table of frequencies (a 2x2 contingency table)
mtcars %>% tab(cyl, gear)

# flat contingency tables of three or more variables
mtcars %>% tab(cyl, gear, am)

mtcars %>% tab(cyl, gear, am, vs)

# ftab() creates only flat contingency tables (here, with two variables)
mtcars %>% ftab(cyl, gear)

# tab1() produces one-way tables for each variable
mtcars %>% tab1(cyl, gear)

# tab2() creates two-way tables for all variable combinations
mtcars %>% tab2(cyl, gear, am)

# ta() is an even shorter alias for tab(), inspired by Stata
mtcars %>% ta(gear)
```
